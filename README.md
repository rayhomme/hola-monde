My First Project
I'm a developer from a product management point of view. I have a vision for a project. And so I find the people with the expertise to pull it off. I bring them todgether and we get it done.
What I'm working on now is Stagecraft.com. A collarobation platform for live events. 
And that's about it.
Except for the project where I'm deleloping a market for the collection of live events.
